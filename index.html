            <li>Application Overview: The application will be a guessing game where the user needs to match types of animals to pictures correctly to earn points. Scores will can be saved to a leaderboard.</li>
            <hr>
            <li>Technology Overview: As of right now I am either looking at using the dogs API or the cats API I have previously used for the animals but am unsure as of now. This will then incude an HTML, CSS, and Javascript files as well.
                I am planning to use MongoDB as a score saver for a leaderboard.</li>

            <li>Feature List: As of right now I would like to have a functioning matching game of some sort with the animals for the final project. I am thinking that I may have a picture dislpayed, and then the user 
                must choose the correct type of animal that is displayed for a point. There will be a way to save the score and a name with the score using MongoDB.</li>
            <hr>
            <li>Future Feature List: The only thing that comes to mind right now would be to have possibly some better graphics for objects in the game because I have no plans for graphics right now.</li>
            <hr>
            <li>Basic Technical Features: As of right now the immediate things I have in mind are the html, css and javascript files, I will be using and API and making a game type thing like Map Mania. MongoDB will be used to save the score of a player.</li>
            <hr>
            <li>Advanced Technical Features: In terms of advanced features, they are unknown to me as of right now. They will be more of a thought when the application is done.</li>
